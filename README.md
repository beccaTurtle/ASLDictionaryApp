## Description
An android app created to close the communication gap between people who use spoken language and those who rely on sign language for communication. 
With the help of the app, short-term caregivers of children, teachers or anyone else may communicate with ASL speakers by providing translation from text spoken language into sign language even when a sign-language translator is missing.
The MainActivity class acts as a link between the underlying model and the user interface (UI).
## Functionality Implemented:
Important Features are as follows:
1. Search Sign and Display: Enables users to perform word searches and presents search results as GIFs. Displays search results for several words in a section with navigation buttons.
2. Browse Categories: Users can look through translations of sign language by category and see them as GIFs.
4. View Favorite List: Users can view a list of their saved or preferred sign language translations by selecting view favorites menu.
5. Add/ Delete Favorite: Allows users to add or remove terms from their favourites list. 
6. UI Navigation allows switching between views, such as browsing, favourites, and the home screen.
## Limitations:
- Static Word Set: This implementation shows examples using a static set of text and GIFs. In an actual setting, words and their connotations would likely be dynamically retrieved from a database.
- Limited Interaction: Right now, the main functions of the app are word favoriting, searching, and browsing. More interactive elements and instructional components may be added in later iterations.
- Small Dictionary Size: For demonstration and operational purposes, a limited set of words and corresponding GIFs are included in the current iteration.

## How to run the prototype

To launch and use the app, follow these steps:
1. Conditions: Make sure your development computer is running Android Studio.
2. Clone Repository: Clone the app in your local machine 
3. Open the app in Android Studio: After opening the project in Android Studio, make sure all required dependencies have been satisfied.
4. Run the app: Use a linked Android device or and Android emulator to run the app (preferably the model: Pixel 5 API 34 )
5. Examine Usability: Explore the app's implemented features which include word search, browsing by the category, and favourite list.
