## First Iteration Plan

| Use Case / Feature | Criticality | Risk | Coverage |
|--------------------|-------------|------|----------|
| Search for ASL     | High        | Low  | High     |
| Browse categories  | Medium      | Low  | High     |
| Add favorite       | Medium      | Low  | Low      |
| View favorite list | Medium      | Low  | Low      |
| Add to dictionary  | Low         | High | Medium   |
| Display ASL sign   | High        | High | High     |


For the next iteration, we will start with prototyping the Search for ASL use case along 
with the capability to visually display ASL signs.

If we have time, we will work on the additional features in the order of browse, favorites 
and then add to dictionary.

## Plan for the Second Iteration:
1. Search for ASL:
- Enhance search functionality for more accurate results. 
- Improve the user interface for a smoother search experience.
2. Display ASL signs:
- Enhance the visual representation of ASL signs with improved animations.
- Make sure the sign language translation is clear and effective.
3. Browse categories:
- Implement the capability for users to explore signs by specific categories.
- Ensure a user-friendly and organized category browsing experience.
4. Add to dictionary:
- Enable users to add custom words to their personal sign language dictionary.
- Ensure that user-added words are effectively stored and retrieved.
5. View favorite list:
- Implement the capability for users to view and manage their saved favorite signs.
- Provide an intuitive user interface for working with favorite signs.

## Plan for the Final Iteration:

1. Refine the UI (make the app pretty!)
   - Make the buttons in the navbar graphical

2. Add more signs to the dictionary
   - Ask for help/feedback from Sign Language faculty at Vassar?

3. Update Favorites:
   - Make it so that a user's list of favorite signs saves from one session to the next, even when the app closes and reopens.
   - Make the favorite list updates in real time without the need to go back to home.


4. Adding a feature to sort signs
